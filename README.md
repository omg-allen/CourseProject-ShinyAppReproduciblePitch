# Author: Al Shain
## Title: Framingham Risk Score Calculator plus WHOish scoring (Readme)

This project is for the Developing Data Projects course offered by John Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health.

# Purpose:
Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will 
need to get started using your application. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server and share the application.
Share your server.R and ui.R code on github.

The application must include the following:

Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.
